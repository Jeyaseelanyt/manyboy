      %h2 Integrate your private or commercial app

      %p &nbsp;

      %h3 Hack, hack, hack

      %p Pull in the information that you have on other apps. Build a device that reports your activities. Bring it all to one place where you can do even more.

      %p Do it for yourself, share your app privately, or request to publish the app on the catalogue.

      %h3 Integrate existing apps

      %p You have a great app that solves your user's problems. You want to give them more control over their information and you want to attract more customers. 

      %p Integrating with Manybots is as easy as integrating with any big platform out there. 
      
      
      %h2 Different types of applications  
      %p &nbsp;

      %h3 Activity observers
  
      %p 
        Use the Manybots API to store activities that you capture with your own apps, or from other apps' APIs. 
      %p   
        It's easy to register your observer and start saving activities. You can also decide whether you'll share your app with other Manybots users on the catalogue. The Manybots API relies on standard web technologies such as REST, OAuth and Activity Streams.

      %p Use agents to read your activities and build upon the power of well formed data: visualizations, alert systems, integrations, federators, or any type of workflow.
  
      %p Read from the OAuth-protected REST JSON endpoint easily using the Manybots API. You can choose whether to publish your agent on the catalogue, and have other Manybots users use it, or keep it to yourself.
